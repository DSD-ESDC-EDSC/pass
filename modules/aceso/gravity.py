THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF BRIAN LEWIS' ACESO MODEL PYTHON PACKAGE

Classes to calculate gravity-based measures of potential spatial accessibility.

These measures assign accessibility scores to demand locations based on their proximity to supply
locations. The main model used here is a gravitational model using non-standard decay functions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        decay_function : callable or str
            If str, the name of a decay function in the ``decay`` module.
            Some available names are 'uniform', 'raised_cosine', and 'gaussian_decay'.

            If callable, a vectorized numpy function returning demand dropoffs by distance.
        decay_params : mapping
            Parameter: value mapping for each argument of the specified decay function.
            These parameters are bound to the decay function to create a one-argument callable.
        huff_normalization: bool
            Flag used to normalize demand through Huff-like interaction probabilities.

            Used in 3SFCA to curtail demand over-estimation.
        suboptimality_exponent: float
            Used in M2SFCA to indicate the extent to account for network suboptimality in access.
            This parameter allows for the differentiation between two scenarios:
                1. Three demand locations each at a distance of 1.0 mile from the sole provider;
                2. Three demand locations each at a distance of 2.0 miles from the sole provider.

            Values greater than 1.0 for this parameter will result in accessibility scores
